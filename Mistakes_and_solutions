Mistakes:
1)Assuming messages from friends are safe without verification.
2)Providing your phone number upon request.
3)Clicking a suspicious link received via SMS or social media.
4)Sending the phishing link back to the friendâ€™s hacked account.
5)Lack of 2FA making the account more vulnerable.

Solutions:
1)If a message seems out of character, confirm with the friend through other channels before responding.
2)Avoid sharing personal information without verifying the identity of the requester.
3)Scrutinize links carefully; only log in through official apps or websites. Inspect links by hovering over or previewing the URL.
4)Refrain from interacting with suspicious accounts and inform friends directly via other secure methods.
5)Enable 2FA on all accounts to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS-based 2FA.
